# Mastering TypeScript

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds static typing to the language.

## Why TypeScript?

- Better IDE support
- Catch errors early
- Improved code documentation
- Enhanced refactoring

\`\`\`ts
interface User {
  name: string
  age: number
}

const user: User = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 30
}
\`\`\`

TypeScript makes your code more maintainable!
\`\`\`

```tsx file="" isHidden
